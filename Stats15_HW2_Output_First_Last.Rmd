# Part 1: Textbook, Section 4.4, Exercise 1

The subset of the `babynames` data has been recreated for you here:

```{r}
year <- c(2003, 1999, 2010, 1989, 1989, 1928, 1981, 1981, 1920, 1941)
sex <- c("M", "F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M")
name <- c("Bilal","Terria","Naziyah","Shawana","Jessi","Tillman","Leslee",
          "Sherise","Marquerite","Lorraine")
n <- as.integer(c(146, 23, 45, 41, 210, 43, 83, 27, 26, 24))
prop <- c(0.0000695, 0.0000118, 0.0000230, 0.0000206, 0.000105 , 0.0000377, 
          0.0000464, 0.0000151, 0.0000209, 0.0000191)
baby_subset <- tibble(year, sex, name, n, prop)
print(baby_subset)
```

Execute the appropriate `dplyr` commands that will recreate the output you see in the textbook.

a. 
```{r, error = TRUE}
baby_subset %>% 
  select(year,sex,name, n) %>% 
  filter(n %in% 41:83)
```

b.
```{r}
baby_subset %>% 
  filter(nchar(name) == 6)
```

c.

```{r}

baby_subset %>% 
  filter(year == 1989) %>% 
  mutate(total=n/prop)

```

d.

```{r}
baby_subset %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(
    total = sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  select(year, total) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```


# Part 2: Textbook, Section 4.4, Exercise 3

The problem with the pipeline is that there will be no column called "am" after summarize the avg_mpg by mean(mpg). Therefore, no data will be filter out from the statement.


# Part 3: Textbook, Section 4.4, Exercise 4

```{r  fig.width = 30, fig.asp = 0.8, out.width = "100%"}
library(Lahman)
Teams %>% 
  tail()


Teams %>% 
  mutate( X1B = H-X2B-X3B-HR) %>% 
  summarize(
    BA = H/AB,
    SLG = ( X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB,
    yearID = yearID,
    teamID = teamID
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x= yearID,
    y= SLG,
    color = teamID 
    ))+geom_line()
```

```{r}
Teams %>% 
  mutate( X1B = H-X2B-X3B-HR) %>% 
  summarize(
    BA = H/AB,
    SLG = ( X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB,
    yearID = yearID,
    teamID = teamID
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x= yearID,
    y= BA,
    color = teamID 
    ))+geom_line()

```

# Part 4: Textbook, Section 4.4, Exercise 7
```{r}
Teams %>% 
  mutate( X1B = H-X2B-X3B-HR) %>% 
  summarize(
    teamID = teamID,
    SLG = ( X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(SLG)) %>% 
  head(5)
```
```{r}

Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID >= 1969) %>% 
  mutate( X1B = H-X2B-X3B-HR) %>% 
  summarize(
    teamID = teamID,
    SLG = ( X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(SLG)) %>% 
  head(5)
  
```

# Part 5: Textbook, Section 4.4, Exercise 8
a.
```{r}

Teams %>% 
  filter (yearID >= 1954) %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  mutate( X1B = H-X2B-X3B-HR) %>% 
  summarise(
    teamID = teamID,
    SLG = ( X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB,
    year = yearID
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = SLG,
    color = lgID
  ))+geom_line(theme = "smooth")
```

AL does have a higher SLG since 1954. According to the graph, most of the time, AL line is above NL line, therefore, it will has a higher mean compare to the others.


# Part 6: Textbook, Section 5.5, Exercise 1

```{r}
statenames <- tibble(names = state.name, twoletter = state.abb)
glimpse(statenames)
```

```{r}
statedata <- tibble(
  names = state.name, 
  income = state.x77[, 2], 
  illiteracy = state.x77[, 3]
  )
glimpse(statedata)
```


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

statedata %>% 
  left_join(statenames, by = c("names" = "names")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = illiteracy,
    y = income,
    color = twoletter
  ))+geom_point()+geom_label_repel( label = rownames(statedata))


```
